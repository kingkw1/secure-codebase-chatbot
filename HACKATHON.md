# 💡 Hackathon Submission: secure-codebase-chatbot

## 🚀 Project Overview

**secure-codebase-chatbot** is a privacy-first, AI-powered chatbot designed to help teams **query, explore, and understand private codebases** without exposing sensitive code to external services. Many organizations—especially in highly regulated industries—face challenges when adopting AI tools due to concerns about data security and cloud-based LLMs.

Our solution provides an **on-premises, air-gap-compatible chatbot**, enabling secure, AI-assisted code navigation for internal repositories.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Software development teams working with proprietary or classified codebases often lack access to AI-powered developer tools that could boost productivity and insight. Current tools (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT) require cloud connectivity, leading to security risks and compliance concerns.

---

## 🛠️ The Solution

**secure-codebase-chatbot** allows organizations to deploy an **LLM-powered chatbot** inside their private network. It crawls local repos, generates metadata, builds embeddings, and serves an AI chatbot via a web interface—fully offline.

### 🔐 Key Highlights:
- 100% local/private repo ingestion (no external API calls).
- Compatible with **Azure AI Services** or self-hosted LLMs (e.g., Ollama).
- Open WebUI integration for a familiar chat experience.
- Optimized for highly secure environments (air-gapped or on-prem networks).

## 🏆 Hackathon Value Proposition

- **Privacy-first**: Empowers secure software teams with modern AI tools.
- **Enterprise-ready**: Designed for industries with high compliance needs (finance, defense, healthcare, etc.).
- **Fully offline**: Works inside closed environments where SaaS tools can't.
- **Plug-and-play**: Easy deployment pipeline using familiar Python and Flask services.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Repo crawler that builds detailed, structured metadata.
- Embedding-based search engine for fast, semantic querying.
- Private LLM integration with support for Azure AI endpoints.
- Custom chatbot pipeline deployable via Open WebUI.

---

## 💪 What's Been Built (Hackathon Progress)
- ✅ Local crawler for metadata extraction.
- ✅ FAISS vector database integration.
- ✅ Flask-based RAG agent with private query pipeline.
- ✅ Open WebUI chatbot connected via custom pipelines.
- ✅ Private LLM-ready (Ollama & Azure AI Service tested).

---

## 🗺️ Next Steps (Post-hackathon)
- ✨ Multimodal input (e.g., voice queries).
- ✨ Automating code documentation generation.
- ✨ Fine-tuned model deployment on private infrastructure.

## 🚨 Why Judges Should Care

This project addresses the **gap between AI tools and secure software teams**, where privacy and regulatory requirements often block adoption of cutting-edge AI copilots. **secure-codebase-chatbot** makes AI-assisted coding accessible to those who need to keep their code **locked down**, while still accelerating development workflows.
