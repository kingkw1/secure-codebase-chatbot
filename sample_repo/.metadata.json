The library will include functions for calculating statistics such as mean and median, as well as functions for performing basic mathematical operations like addition and sub tra ction. The library will also include tests for each function to ensure correct ness. ## Us age To use this library, simply import the desired module and call the appropriate function. For example: ```fromdata_processorimportcalculateresult=calculate.add(2,3)print(result)#Output:5```##Features Thefollowingfeaturesareincludedinthislibrary:*Calculationofmeanandmedianstatistics*Basicmathematicaloperationslikeadditionandsubtraction*Testsforeachfunctiontoensurecorrectness##Installation Toinstallthislibrary,simplyclonetherepositoryfrom Git Hub:```gitclonehttps://github.com/<username>/data-processing-library.git```Then,navigatetotheclonedrepositoryandrunthefollowingcommandtoinstallthelibrary:```pipinstall.``` This will install the library and its dependencies in your Python environment. ## Cont rib uting Cont ribution s are welcome !
