          "comment": "\n This  code  defines  a  function  called  ` main `  that  performs  various  mathematical  operations  on  a  list  of  numbers .  The  function  first  initial izes  the  list  of  numbers  and  then  calls  four  different  functions  to  perform  calculations :  ` add `,  ` sub t ract `,  ` mean `,  and  ` med ian `.  The  output  is  printed  to  the  console  for  each  calculation . \n \n The  comment  provides  a  brief  description  of  what  each  line  of  code  does ,  which  makes  it  easy  for  someone  reading  the  code  to  understand  the  purpose  of  each  function .  The  comment  also  includes  a  sample  input  and  output ,  which  helps  to  illustrate  how  the  functions  work  in  practice .  Over all ,  this  comment  is  inform ative  and  helpful  for  anyone  who  needs  to  modify  or  understand  the  code . "

It includes functions to calculate statistics, perform basic mathematical operations, and more. ## Pur pose The purpose of this project is to create a mod ular and scal able code base for processing data in Python. The package includes several modules with well - defined interfaces that can be easily extended or modified to suit different use cases. ## Us age To use the Data Process or, import it into your Python script using the following command: \n``` python import data_ processor \n``` Then, you can call any of the functions provided by the package using their names paces, such as ` data_ processor. calcul ate ` or ` data_ processor. stat istics `. For example, to calculate the mean and median of a list of numbers, you can use the following code: \n``` python import data_ processor numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] mean = data_ processor. stat istics. mean ( numbers ) med ian = data_ processor. stat istics. med ian ( numbers ) print ( f \" The mean is { mean }, and the median is { med ian }\") \n``` ## Fe atures The Data Process or package includes several features that make it useful for processing data in Python: 1. *\n* Stat istics \n**: The ` data_ processor. stat istics ` module provides functions to calculate statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation. 2. *\n* Math emat ical Oper ations \n**: The ` data_ processor. calcul ate ` module includes functions for basic mathematical operations such as addition, sub tra ction, multiplication, and division. 3. *\n* Extensions \n**: The package is designed to be extens ible, so you can easily add new modules or functions to suit your specific needs. 4. *\n* Mod ular Design \n**: The code is struct ured in a mod ular way, making it easy to understand and maintain. 5. *\n* Test ing \n**: The package includes testing scripts for all the modules and functions, ens uring that they work as expected and are reliable. 6. *\n* Document ation \n**: The package is well - document ed with clear instructions on how to use each function. 7. *\n* Scal ability \n**: The package can be used with large datasets and is designed to scale up or down depending on your needs. 8. *\n* Rob ust ness \n**: The package includes robust error handling and exception handling, ens uring that it can handle unexpected data or inputs."
